## Background

The e-bike startup industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, with companies focused on developing new technologies and designs to improve the performance and convenience of e-bikes. Some startups are creating e-bikes specifically for commuting or delivery services, while others are developing innovative battery and motor technologies to increase range and power. The industry is attracting significant investment from venture capital firms and other investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of e-bikes.

## Problem Statement

- Vir Bike plans to develop a No Code website that provides users with information about e-bikes, such as battery needs and environmental impact. 
- Users will enter their travel details, and the website will calculate battery power needed, pedalling required, and real-time tracking. 
- No Code tools like Thunkable, Glide, and Webflow will be used to create the website. 
- The goal is to encourage e-bike adoption for a more sustainable future.
- Vir Bike hopes to inspire a greater adoption of e-bikes, which will cut carbon emissions and contribute to a more environmentally friendly future.
